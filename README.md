# telegram-bot
My Python telegram bot project based on pyTelegramBotAPI.
You can find it on https://t.me/nagraivBot
I develop a TODO bot made according to free Netology course.
Now my bot can add, show and delete tasks on given dates (lists).
There are Keyboard Buttons for easy navigation through its menu.
Also it can play two mini games to amuse you.
This bot can chat simultaneously several persons as it saves user ID, names and some other cookies.
